This document is a master list of all of the stuff I plan to put in the game. Most of this
stuff isn't in the game yet.

TODO: process http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Monster_attacks for ideas

Main features
=============

* Binding of Isaac style top-down twin-stick bullet-hell-lite roguelite gameplay
* Randomly generated levels _vaguely_ in the vein of diablo (i.e. large maps as opposed to individual BoI style rooms)
* Very basic xp/leveling system, a la Risk of Rain - no talent tree, manual stat allocation, etc, just cumulative stat increases

Mechanics I'm definitely adding
-------------------------------

* Spacebar items like Binding of Isaac
* Passive items like Binding of Isaac
* Minimap
  * this implies fog of war / visibility

Mechanics I'm undecided on
--------------------------

* Mana, spells
  * Monsters will definitely have these, but not sure whether player will

Monster types
-------------

* Basic chaser: follows you, shoots at you
* Summoner (fallen shamans from diablo)
* Healer
* Siege enemies of some sort, something in the vein of siege tanks
* Swarmer
* Spellcaster, glass-cannon-style mage, casts skillshots (jaina's icicle) as well as aoes (jaina's blizzard)

Status effects
--------------

* Invincibility
* Poison
* Slow
* Stun
* Confusion (only to enemy characters, don't let this happen to the player character, it isn't fun)

Combat-related features
-----------------------

Some of the items you can find will give you these abilities

* Lifesteal
* Mind control (you can only do this to super basic enemies way below your level, with a very small chance of success)
* Permanent health gain when enemies die (from risk of rain - too OP?)
